# bui | beautiful user interfaces
bui is a collection of libraries, plugins, wrappers, etc to make UI development more productive.

The first project to be tackled is a three.js and masonry wrapper for creating an interactive dashboard widget.

Bower install: `bower install bui`
Npm install `npm install b-ui` (Yeah, I know, someone already registered a bui.)
